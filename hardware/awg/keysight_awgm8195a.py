"""
Discussion about sampling the waveform for the AWG. This text will move 
eventually to the sampling method, but will stay for the initial start of the
implementation in this file.

The information for the file format are taken from the Keysight M8195 user 
manual, from section 6.21.10 (p. 247), to be found here:

http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/M8195-91040.pdf?id=2678487


We will choose the native file format for the M8195 series with is called BIN8:

It is a binary file format (written in small endian), representing an 8bit 
integer and expressing a real value (not complex for iq modulation).

8bit are for each single channel only and contain no parameter header and no
data header. Excerpt from the manual:

BIN8
is the most memory efficient file format for the M8195A without digital markers. 
As a result, the fastest file download can be achieved.
One file contains waveform samples for one channel. The waveform samples can be 
imported to any of the four M8195A channels. Samples consist of binary int8 
values:


   7   |   6   |   5   |   4   |   3   |   2   |   1   |   0   |
----------------------------------------------------------------
  DB7  | DB6   |  DB5  |  DB4  |  DB3  |  DB2  |  DB1  |  DB0  |

DB = Data bit

so to convert a number to a 8bit representation you have to know the amplitude
range. Here it will be -0.5 V to +0.5 V, so 1Vpp. Therefore -0.5V corresponds to
0 and +0.5V to 255 (since 2^8=256). Hence the conversion is done in the 
following way:

x = float number between -0.5V and +0.5V to be converted to int8:

    int8((x + 0.5)*255)

or of an array:

    x_bin = ((x + 0.5)*255).astype('int8')
